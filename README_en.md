# Reti Logiche: Final Project - AY 2021/2022

The Final Project for the Reti Logiche exam (w.r.t. AY 2021/2022) consisted of the sumbission of a single source code [file](project_reti_logiche.vhd) containing the required hardware component's description and a single documentation file that could explain the implementation choices, as well as presenting its experimental results.

## Project's specification

The project's specification consisted of an implementation of an hardware module (described in the VHDL language) that interfaces itself with a given memory and that follows the given [specification](PFRL_Specifica_21_22_V3.pdf) (only available in the Italian language). To sum up, it's an hardware implementation of the *1/2 convolutional coding algorithm*, widely used in the Telecommunications field as an encryption method.

## Documentation

The project's documentation can be found [here](relazione.pdf) (only available in the Italian language).
